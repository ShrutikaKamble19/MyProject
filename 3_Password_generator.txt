import random
#random: This module provides functions to generate random numbers, choose random elements, and shuffle sequences, which is essential for creating a random password.

import string
#string: This module contains useful constants, such as ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits, and punctuation, which represent lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters, respectively.

def generate_password(length=12):
    if length < 4:
        raise ValueError("Password length should be at least 4 characters.")

#generate_password(length=12): This function generates a random password. The length parameter determines the number of characters in the password, defaulting to 12 if not specified.
#if length < 4: A minimum length of 4 is enforced to ensure that thereâ€™s enough space to include each character type (lowercase, uppercase, digit, special character). If the length is less than 4, it raises an error to prompt the user to increase the length.

    lowercase = string.ascii_lowercase
    uppercase = string.ascii_uppercase
    digits = string.digits
    special_chars = string.punctuation

#Here, we define four variables representing different sets of characters:
#lowercase: All lowercase letters (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)
#uppercase: All uppercase letters (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ)
#digits: All numbers (0123456789)
#special_chars: Common special characters (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~`)

    all_chars = lowercase + uppercase + digits + special_chars
#all_chars: This variable combines all character types into a single pool, which will be used to add random characters to the password after ensuring the required complexity.

    password = [
        random.choice(lowercase),
        random.choice(uppercase),
        random.choice(digits),
        random.choice(special_chars),
    ]
#password: This list starts with one random character from each category (lowercase, uppercase, digit, special character). By selecting one of each type, the password is guaranteed to meet basic complexity requirements.

    password += random.choices(all_chars, k=length - 4)
#random.choices(all_chars, k=length - 4): Here, random.choices is used to pick additional random characters from all_chars to fill out the rest of the password length (total length minus 4, since we already added one of each type).
#password +=: The generated random characters are appended to the password list.

    random.shuffle(password)
#random.shuffle(password): This function randomly shuffles the list to mix the order of characters, removing any predictable pattern (e.g., lowercase first, then uppercase, etc.).

    return ''.join(password)
#''.join(password): The password list, which contains all the characters of the password, is joined into a single string and returned.

password = generate_password(12)
print("Generated Password:", password)

#generate_password(12): Calls the function with a length of 12 characters.
#print("Generated Password:", password): Prints the generated password.
